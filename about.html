                    <p class="para">Hello, and welcome to my site. My name is Joe Romsa and I am currently a junior studying Computer Science with a minor in 
                        Management and Information Systems at the University of Nebraska Omaha. I am an Omaha native, where I grew up in the Springfield area 
                        and attended Platteview High School. I enjoy reading, cooking, photography, and anything computer related.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">My recently, I interned at The Rush Market as a software development inter. There I gained lots of experience working in an 
                        agile development environment. I worked on multiple projects there using the Vue.Js framework. I also helped in testing using Jira and provided
                        level one help desk support to the office.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">Outside of my school studies and projects, I enjoy learning as much as I can about different technologies and the field of computer science. 
                        I have some personal projects such as some python scripts and games I have worked on. My projects can be seen on my github which will continue to grow with 
                        new projects. 

                    </p>
